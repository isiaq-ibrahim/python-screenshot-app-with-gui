# single line comment in Python

# basic math operation
# a = 58
# b = 100
# c = a+b
# d = a*b
# e = b-a
# print(c)
# print("The answer is", c)
# print("The multiplication of a and b =",d)
# print("The subtraction of a from b =",e)


# how to accept input from users in Python

# make sure to run this in terminal and not in output
# f = input("Enter first number\n")
# the new line ensures that the user input starts on a new line instead of been beside the text "Enter first number"
# print(f)

# how to output the datatype
# g = int(input("Enter second number"))
# print(type(g))

# h = int(input("Enter third number\n"))

# if h%2==0:
#     print(h,"is an even number")

# else:
#     print(h,"is an odd number")


# a = int(input("Enter some number\n"))

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i*a)

# fruits = ["apple","banana","orange", "cashew","pawpaw","lemon","kiwi","pineapple","grape","water melon","pear"]
# this is a list and it will print pineapple at the output
# print(fruits[7])
# print(type(fruits))


# fruits = ("apple","banana","orange", "cashew","pawpaw","lemon","kiwi","pineapple","grape","water melon","pear")
# print(fruits[4])
# print(type(fruits))
# # this is a tuple and it will print pawpaw at the output

# fruits = {"apple","banana","orange", "cashew","pawpaw","lemon","kiwi","pineapple","grape","water melon","pear"}
# print(fruits)
# print(type(fruits))
# this is a set and it will print pawpaw at the output
